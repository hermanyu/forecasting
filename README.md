# Forecasting

This repository stores notes, computations, examples, and project work related to forecasting time-series data. This repository is organized into 3 main components:

1) The `Theory` directory contains notes, computations, and simulations pertaining to the mathematical theory of time-series data and models. See the References section for details on where these ideas are presented in detail.

2) The `Projects` directory contains the applied work of forecasting on actual data. Each project is contained it it's own directory and split into an `EDA` and `Models` section, containing the respective types of work.

3) The `R` directory contains modularized components of code for re-use across projects.
